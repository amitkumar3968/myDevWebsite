What are the disadvantages of using Jekyll (static site generator) for programmers and non-programmers?
From a developer point of view you don't have access to on-demand processing. So you can't easily do things like search, dynamic listings, form submissions, etc. You could use a combination of third party services and client side code to replicate those, but that adds complexity due to integrations.

From a client perspective markdown is often annoying to use. You also have to have some way for a user to update the file and move it to the server. A lot of the time this is version control, often times just the Github UI. There are a lot of people who will have problems with that. Especially if you do things like branching or tagging.
